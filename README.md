## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I felt in love with Python about 2.5 years ago when I built a 2-D game. I was learning about Object-Oriented Programming as part of a course I was undertaking. Since then I have grown into loving
the elegance, syntax, readability and simplicity of the Python Programming Language.

I have done several personal projects with the core Python Language itself, and with Python frameworks,
including Django, Django Rest Framework, FastAPI and Flask. I appreciate the versatility of Python, you could solve almost any computational or real-world problems with the language. You can't confidently say that about JavaScript, can you?

At the moment, I am open to any entry-level to mid-level Python backend developer positions, ideally in a startup environment where a lot of building stuff from scratch is ongoing. Send me an email at nodhiambo01@gmail.com or reach me at +254 795 555 416
